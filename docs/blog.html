      <div class="blog-entry">
          <p> This week, each member has been working on WebXR demo projects to familiarize themselves with the tools for the main project, as well as working on the website and discussing project ideas. We created a document of what our project should include in terms of the environment, controls, objectives, tasks, stretch goals, and bottlenecks which we will refine in class. In class, we went through various tutorials to familiarize ourselves with WebXR and VR programming.
        We also started the code for our website and worked individually on the WebXR tutorials. </p>
        <p>Our idea for the project is to create a VR experience in space where a player can move around in different gravitational fields and complete tasks to fix a space station. The player would work through a set of tasks while moving around the inside and outside of the space station. The basic storyline is that an astronaut has woken up to find their spaceship critically damaged, there is a list of tasks that must be completed to remove risks, fix the space station, and establish communication with the team on Earth to send aid.
        </p><p>Next week we will come up with a project pitch and create our Project Requirements Document (PRD). </p>
        <p>As for blocking issues, we are wondering what the best way is to obtain 3D models that will be consistent with each other as we build our scenes. </p>

      <div class="blog-entry">
	      <p>The following is what each team member accomplished this week:</p>
	      <ul>
        <li>
		<p>Caelen worked on the pitch slideshow as well as the Project Requirements Document.</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Devika worked on the pitch slideshow as well as the Project Requirements Document.</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Elana worked on the pitch slideshow as well as interactions between players and objects for the demo application.</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Timo worked on the pitch slideshow as well as the multiplayer platform through croquet for the demo application.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>As far as progress on our project, we built a demo application using Croquet to create a multiplayer experience where two players can interact with a ball in a space station corridor. Players can also click a button to rotate the entire corridor. Our code can be found on Glitch <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/event-horizon">here</a>. Additionally, we created our Project Requirements Document, which can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1R6KDe2fKX-x0AnGHcQj6KOr5SLTnCKr-LeSUIglbU/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a> </p>
	      
<p>We also ironed out more of the goals of the game this week: we want to make a two-player cooperative game set on a broken down space station! Our two characters will be a human and a robot that must work together to fix the space station and find help. We have some new ideas for the tasks they must complete. We aim to have tutorial areas for both players where they can try out their special abilities like computer hacking or picking up and resizing items, which requires communication to leave, followed by a task to repair a generator utilizing wiring skills and flashlights. </p>
	      
<p>Next week we will be focusing on building out the MVP for our game, starting with our environment, which we will be getting from the Unity Asset store once our budget is approved. We also plan on building out our initial tasks for each player. Each team member will be focused on their specific area of specialization: Caelen will be building out the environment, Devika will focus on in-game objectives, Elana will improve the player movements and controls, and Timo will continue working on the multiplayer capabilities and networking. </p>
	      
<p>As for blocking issues, our animated corridor does not seem to work when two players are in the scene. When one of the players clicks the button to rotate the corridor, it starts the animation, but then stops and returns the corridor to its original position for some reason. We’re not really sure why it only does this when there are multiple players in a scene. Additionally, when two players are in the scene, the ball appears to flash between two locations for both players after it is moved from its original location. </p>
