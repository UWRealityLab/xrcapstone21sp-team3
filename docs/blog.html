<h1 id="header-1">Week 1</h1>
            
<p> This week, each member has been working on WebXR demo projects to familiarize themselves with the tools for the main project, as well as working on the website and discussing project ideas. We created a document of what our project should include in terms of the environment, controls, objectives, tasks, stretch goals, and bottlenecks which we will refine in class. In class, we went through various tutorials to familiarize ourselves with WebXR and VR programming.
We also started the code for our website and worked individually on the WebXR tutorials. </p>
<p>Our idea for the project is to create a VR experience in space where a player can move around in different gravitational fields and complete tasks to fix a space station. The player would work through a set of tasks while moving around the inside and outside of the space station. The basic storyline is that an astronaut has woken up to find their spaceship critically damaged, there is a list of tasks that must be completed to remove risks, fix the space station, and establish communication with the team on Earth to send aid.
<p>Next week we will come up with a project pitch and create our Project Requirements Document (PRD). </p>
<p>As for blocking issues, we are wondering what the best way is to obtain 3D models that will be consistent with each other as we build our scenes. </p>
