          <p> This week, each member has been working on WebXR demo projects to familiarize themselves with the tools for the main project, as well as working on the website and discussing project ideas. We created a document of what our project should include in terms of the environment, controls, objectives, tasks, stretch goals, and bottlenecks which we will refine in class. In class, we went through various tutorials to familiarize ourselves with WebXR and VR programming.
        We also started the code for our website and worked individually on the WebXR tutorials. </p>
        <p>Our idea for the project is to create a VR experience in space where a player can move around in different gravitational fields and complete tasks to fix a space station. The player would work through a set of tasks while moving around the inside and outside of the space station. The basic storyline is that an astronaut has woken up to find their spaceship critically damaged, there is a list of tasks that must be completed to remove risks, fix the space station, and establish communication with the team on Earth to send aid.
        </p><p>Next week we will come up with a project pitch and create our Project Requirements Document (PRD). </p>
        <p>As for blocking issues, we are wondering what the best way is to obtain 3D models that will be consistent with each other as we build our scenes. </p>
      </div>

    <div class="blog-header" id="W2">Week 2</div>
    <div class="horizontal-divider"></div>
      <div class="blog-entry">
	      <p>The following is what each team member accomplished this week:</p>
	      <ul>
        <li>
		<p>Caelen worked on the pitch slideshow as well as the Project Requirements Document.</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Devika worked on the pitch slideshow as well as the Project Requirements Document.</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Elana worked on the pitch slideshow as well as interactions between players and objects for the demo application.</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Timo worked on the pitch slideshow as well as the multiplayer platform through croquet for the demo application.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>As far as progress on our project, we built a demo application using Croquet to create a multiplayer experience where two players can interact with a ball in a space station corridor. Players can also click a button to rotate the entire corridor. Our code can be found on our GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/UWRealityLab/xrcapstone21sp-team3">here</a>. Additionally, we created our Project Requirements Document, which can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1R6KDe2fKX-x0AnGHcQj6KOr5SLTnCKr-LeSUIglbU/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a> </p>
	      
<p>We also ironed out more of the goals of the game this week: we want to make a two-player cooperative game set on a broken down space station! Our two characters will be a human and a robot that must work together to fix the space station and find help. We have some new ideas for the tasks they must complete. We aim to have tutorial areas for both players where they can try out their special abilities like computer hacking or picking up and resizing items, which requires communication to leave, followed by a task to repair a generator utilizing wiring skills and flashlights. </p>
	      
<p>Next week we will be focusing on building out the MVP for our game, starting with our environment, which we will be getting from the Unity Asset store once our budget is approved. We also plan on building out our initial tasks for each player. Each team member will be focused on their specific area of specialization: Caelen will be building out the environment, Devika will focus on in-game objectives, Elana will improve the player movements and controls, and Timo will continue working on the multiplayer capabilities and networking. </p>
	      
<p>As for blocking issues, our animated corridor does not seem to work when two players are in the scene. When one of the players clicks the button to rotate the corridor, it starts the animation, but then stops and returns the corridor to its original position for some reason. We’re not really sure why it only does this when there are multiple players in a scene. Additionally, when two players are in the scene, the ball appears to flash between two locations for both players after it is moved from its original location. </p>

      <div class="blog-entry">
	      <p>The following is what each team member accomplished this week:</p>
	      <ul>
        <li>
		<p>Caelen worked on acquiring a 3D model of the space station interior, and editing it in Blender to fit our specifications and narrative.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Devika worked on creating one of the initial interactions for the “robot” player, which is clear fallen debris with the robot’s ability to move objects at a range with raycasting (similar to “the force”). So far, we have blocks that can be raycasted to, but we are still working on being able to make it grabbable at the same distance so it can be moved in that range.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Elana created one of the initial interactions for the “human” player, which is to seal a hole where air is leaking out. So far, we have a cylinder (which will later be the Spray Sealer™) that shoots out spheres (representing the sealer) when you grab it.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Timo worked on creating and alternating character models for players when connecting.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>We’re moving our codebase from Glitch to GitHub! Our code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/UWRealityLab/xrcapstone21sp-team3">UWRealityLab/xrcapstone21sp-team3 (github.com)</a>
 </p>
	      
<p>Our biggest update is that we have an initial map layout! We planned out the introductory areas for our brave astronaut and robot characters, and have tasks planned to fill out those areas. One idea we’re excited about on the human side is an air leak that must be fixed using a Spray Sealer™ (similar to a fire extinguisher). On the robot side of things, we will soon be seeing a telekinetic power to move debris out of the way so the robot can clear the way to a computer terminal.
 </p>
	      
<p>We will continue to work towards getting our minimum viable product, which will be done by May 4th. Next week, we will be focusing on building out more of the intro sequence. Caelen will be focused on implementing models into our current environment and creating the robot’s terminal screen, Devika will continue building initial objectives and interactions for the players, Elana will work to enable physics for the player characters as well as help implement interactions, and Timo will work on implementing specific controls for each of our characters.</p>
	      
<p>We’ve been having trouble importing .obj models into our project. For the time being, we’re looking to use .gltf models only, but it would be nice to expand the selection of models we can choose from. We’re also planning on hosting our app on a GitLab repository instead of Glitch because Glitch is having a hard time loading the space station model we are using for our map.

	      <ul>
        <li>
		<p>Caelen worked on decreasing the size of the map, as well as implementing the wiring task.
</p>
        </li>

	<li>
		<p>Elana fixed some bugs and improved interactions for the human’s initial tasks, which are to seal the crack in the window and to use the flashlight to identify the shape of the room they are in.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Timo worked on the character models, the croquet physics system, the integration of the codebase onto gitlab, as well as investigating bugs in the multiplayer of the integrated code</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>We started integrating all our code to a gitlab repository where we will be hosting our app in the future due to performance constraints. You can now find our code <a href="https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse481v-21sp/team3">here</a>, and our most up to date demo <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse481v/21sp/projects/team3/">here</a>.
 </p>
	      
<p>Our plan for the MVP coming up soon is largely the same, so this week we have decided to give you a look into the features we have whipped up! Here are some demo videos of the interactions and environment we have been building: 
		  </p>
		  <p>Here is a video demonstrating the 'telekinesis' ability: <video width="450" height="270" controls=""><source src="./videos/moving_block_at_distance.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>
		  
		  <p>Here is a video demonstrating the Spray Sealer™ sealing the crack in the window, the lights turning off as a result of sealing the window, and the flashlight: <video width="450" height="270" controls=""><source src="./videos/com.oculus.browser-20210429-114036.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>
		  <p>And here is a video showing off part of the map we plan on using with the items the robot will eventually have to move to do their task: <video width="450" height="270" controls=""><source src="./videos/debris_items_view.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>
	      
<p>This next week we will be integrating and finalizing our code in preparation for the MVP presentation on May 4th (may the 4th be with you) and squashing any bugs we find along the way. We will also be working on our presentation for the same day. Individually, Caelen will work on making the map smaller in size so our app can load on the Oculus Quest 2, Devika will finish interactions for the robot character for the first stage and begin interactions for final stage, Elana will finish interactions for the human character for the first stage and begin implementing zero gravity, and Timo will create interactions between human and robot players and ensure physics are working properly. Additionally, we will all work to integrate each element we have been working on this week into a single codebase and environment.</p>
	      
<p>This past week, we finally got access to a single repository with enough storage to handle our larger assets, however we found the large file size of our map and some assets is an issue to performance and load times in the WebVR environment. We are working to reduce these file sizes to fit our constraints. There was also some struggle finding a way to sync character model movements to the controller movements, so we are using floating heads with hands synced to controllers to represent our characters. Finally, we’ve had some issues with the croquet physics system and interactions with objects, and while we’ve figured out most of the problems, we’re going to save the use of this system for future levels of the game where object synchronization will be needed due to the players no longer being separated. For the MVP the players are separated, so we will use a local physics system for now.

      <div class="blog-entry">
	      <p>The following is what each team member accomplished this week:</p>
	      <ul>
        <li>
		<p>Caelen worked on finishing up the wiring puzzle, added doors to separate the rooms, and made adjustments to the debris positioning, as well as recorded footage for the demo video.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Devika worked on fixing two main bugs for the robot’s first task, stable box positioning and single object telekinesis through a shorter laser.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Elana fixed bugs related to the human player’s tasks to ensure events occurred at correct times for the MVP, as well as debugging the issue we are having where light does not reflect off our textures in the Oculus browser.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p>Timo worked on fixing up croquet loading issues, developing separate controls for human and robot players, as well as recording footage for the demo video.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>This week we worked on integrating our individual code for tasks and interactions into a single codebase for the MVP (check out our codebase on GitLab <a href="https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse481v-21sp/team3"> here</a>), fixed a couple bugs, added final touches for the demo. Together, we worked on getting our demo ready to present by creating a script, adding our slides to the deck, and recording the key gameplay elements that we have been working on so far.

<p>Our plan for the upcoming week is to improve the player experience, especially by creating clear and distinct hand gestures, having smoother asset rendering, and including better textures, and working on the next level of the game where the robot and human meet. Individually, Timo will focus on making object positions shared between players so they can interact with each other in the same scene, either using Croquet physics or possibly migrating to Networked A-frame. Elana will be working to make player movement more intuitive for Oculus Quest 2 controllers by replacing our current teleportation component with a different one, as well as try to improve player interactions with objects by improving the grabbing mechanisms. Caelen will be working to resize our textures for our map model so the experience on the Oculus browser can be improved. Devika will be working on planning interactions for the next level in our app and will start building some of the interactions.</p>
	      
<p>Looking ahead, we know that we will need more rooms for future scenes and levels, so we worked on trying to find a way to possibly unload assets that were currently not in use for a scene. Since map size has been one of our main struggles for rendering the game on the Oculus, we wanted to be proactive in trying to solve this. A potential solution we are looking into is disposing of objects from previous levels when switching to a new level. We also faced issues with lighting for our scene this week. The lighting looks as expected in the desktop view, but doesn’t work on the headset which may be due to textures being too large. We are looking into compressing our models and textures for the map even more than we already have to see if that allows lights to reflect off of them.

    <div class="horizontal-divider"></div>
      <div class="blog-entry">
	      <p>The following is what each team member accomplished this week:</p>
	      <ul>
        <li>
		<p> Caelen repacked the map model with proportional textures to fix edge jittering in headset, inverted mesh normals to allow interior lighting in headset, and implemented level transition by toggling scene visibility.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p> Devika worked on adding blink-controls (that were eventually switched for joystick movement) and experimenting with zero gravity with a focus on smoother movement.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p> Elana researched how to implement zero gravity movement and began experimenting with A-frame physics and kinematic-body.
</p>
        </li>
	<li>
		<p> Timo experimented with Croquet physics to see if we would be able to use it with our app and he also started replacing Croquet with Networked A-frame once we decided to switch. 
</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p> We are planning on substituting Networked A-frame for Croquet to enable multiplayer functionality because we are having difficulties using physics with Croquet. As physics plays a major role in our game, we think Networked A-frame will give players a smoother experience when interacting in a shared environment. Additionally, we have started a branch to experiment with zero gravity movement, which can be found <a href="https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse481v-21sp/team3/-/tree/zeroG">here</a>.
 </p>
	      
<p> We decided to remove the teleportation functionality and only allow the player to use joystick movement to navigate the map. Additionally, we are beginning to plan for our final level and want to focus on implementing zero gravity movement before designing tasks for the players to “win” the game.
</p>  
	      
<p> Additionally, we added the functionality for players to progress to the next level by unloading assets from the previous level and loading new assets. Here is a video demonstrating that functionality: <video width="450" height="270" controls=""><source src="./videos/com.oculus.browser-20210513-230926.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
</p>
	      
<p> We are also hoping to give each player a new “ability” that they did not have in the first level: we’re giving the “robot” character a laser cutter and the “human” character the ability to shoot fire and a freezing substance from their hands.
</p>
	      
<p> Next week, we will continue experimenting with zero gravity movement, as well as with Networked A-frame. We will also start implementing the human’s and robot’s new abilities. Elana and Devika will continue researching zero gravity and work to make it a smoother experience for the players. Caelen and Timo will work on implementing Networked A-frame, as well as implementing the players’ new abilities if they have the time.
</p>
	      
<p> We are working to allow players to move around in zero gravity and are having some issues with physics when the hands are involved. Currently, we are just relying on A-frame physics, but the motions are very jerky and aggressive. We will try experimenting with adding our own velocities when the users push against a wall or an object so that the movement is smoother, but any other suggestions for improving the movement are appreciated.
